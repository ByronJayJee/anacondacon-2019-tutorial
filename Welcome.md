Welcome To Dask Examples
========================

This is a live session from which you can run example notebooks showing how to
use Dask.

Dask dashboard plots are available to the right. These will activate when you
run the cells in your Jupyter notebooks that create a Dask cluster and client
(these cells are already written for you).

To get started, select a notebook and start working through the Jupyter
notebook cells. You will eventually get to exercise cells that will require you
to do some work.
